The swift port of Outset is a direct feature for feature (almost) replacement for the python version of Outset by Joseph Chilcote.

### What Isn't ported

Recent version of macos restrict the installation of `.mobileconfig` files in a useful way outside of MDM and from macOS 11 Big Sur onwards, the `profiles` command can no longer be used to install configuration profiles, so makes no sense to continue support for this feature.

Future releases may also remove the capability to install packages as this also is something that is better served from your MDM or other application management toolkit.

### What's installed

Appart from the `Outset` app, the pkg also includes some other files:

#### Agents
`/Library/LaunchDaemons/` `/Library/LaunchAgents/`

Updated with the `AssociatedBundleIdentifiers` key so under macOS 13, Login Items show everything under the 'Outset' title

#### Outset.app

![Outset Icon](https://github.com/bartreardon/outset/blob/master/outset/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset/Outset.png_32x32@2x.png?raw=true) 

`/usr/local/outset/Outset.app`

Apart from being an app bundle, this app has the BundleID of `io.macadmins.Outset` which is used to show in macOS 13 Login Items under the same app bundle and with an icon. 

## Building the project

Add your developer certificate in the signing and capabilities of the "Outset App Bundle" build targets in Xcode. Select the "Outset Installer Package" scheme and build. This should generate an `Outset.pkg` in your `Build/Products/Release` directory.
